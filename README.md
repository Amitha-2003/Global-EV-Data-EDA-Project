Global Electric Vehicle Market Analysis using Python (EDA Project)
Author: Amitha K S

Project Overview
This project analyzes the Global Electric Vehicle (EV) Market using data from the IEA Global EV Data 2024.
It explores EV sales, stock, charging infrastructure, and powertrain adoption trends worldwide from 2010–2024.

Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global EV data and uncover key insights about:
•	Growth of EV adoption globally
•	Leading countries and regions in EV sales
•	Market share by EV powertrain types (BEV, PHEV)
•	Correlation between EV usage, electricity demand, and oil displacement

Tools & Libraries Used
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
•	Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights
1.	EV sales have grown exponentially, especially after 2015.
2.	China, the US, and Europe lead the EV market.
3.	BEVs dominate over PHEVs in market share.
4.	EV charging infrastructure is rapidly expanding.
5.	Electricity demand correlates positively with EV stock growth.

Dataset
Source: IEA Global EV Data 2024
Includes metrics like EV stock, sales, electricity demand, and charging points for multiple countries and years.
